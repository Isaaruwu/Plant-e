# :cactus: Plant-e :potted_plant:
Plant-e is a self-watering plant system built using the Arduino MKR Wifi1010. It enables you to effortlessly monitor soil moisture, ambient temperature, and ambient light levels. The data collected from these sensors can be conveniently viewed and analyzed using the Arduino Dashboard, accessible on both mobile and desktop platforms. The system incorporates an automated pump system that initiates watering as soon as the soil moisture falls below a certain threshold. Additionally, it leverages the IFTTT API to send notifications to your phone, alerting you when the system is watering.
